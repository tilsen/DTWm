This toolbox "dtw-more" or "dtw-matlab" (dtwm) is in part a Matlab port 
of Toni Giorgino's dtw package for python/R. 
See: Giorgino (2009) Computing and Visualizing Dynamic Time Warping 
Alignments in R: The dtw Package. This package was written by Sam Tilsen
and Mark Tiede.

dtwm does more than built-in Matlab dtw: it allows for local slope 
 constraints, global windows, and partial matching. It also contains
 functions for calculation of the local slope of the dtw warping curve,
 which is equivalent to the local relative rate of one signal to another.


GET STARTED:

1) Run the livescript dtwm_examples.mlx, or dtwm_examples_script to get started.
The output of the livescript is published in dtwm_examples.pdf.



Help for dtwm:


Use: 
     dtwm(x1,x2) where x1 and x2 are input signals
        
 or  dtwm(D) where D is a distance matrix
 
 Optional input parameters:

   'dist_method':    'euclidean' (default); other methods not yet implemented

   'step_pattern':   'symmetric2' (default); see documentation for alternatives

   'window_type':    'none' (default), 'SakoeChiba', 'Itakura', 'SlantedBand'

   'window_args':    {}; additional arguments for some windows. see
                   documentation for examples.

   'keep_internals': true (default) or false; keeps some information that might not
                   be needed

   'open_end':       true or false (default); allow for partial matching at end
 
   'open_begin':     true or false (default); allow for partial matching at begin

   'use_mex':        true (default) or false; use compiled mex file for
                   determining optimal warping path. 'false' will be very slow

 Outputs:

   wcurve:     the warping curve

   dist:       the distance after alignment

   gcm:        additional information, including the global cost matrix

Cost matrices (both input and output) have query elements arranged
row-wise (first index), and reference elements column-wise (second
index). They print according to the usual convention, with indexes
increasing down- and rightwards. Many DTW papers and tutorials show
matrices according to plot-like conventions, i_e. reference index
growing upwards. This may be confusing.
