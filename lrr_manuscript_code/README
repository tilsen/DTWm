The contents of this directory contain all of the code 
necessary to conduct the analyses and generate figures of the manuscript:
Tilsen & Tiede (under review) Looking within events:
examining internal temporal structure with local relative rate.

Note that the function tw_helpers.m must be edited to specify paths to the input data,
which are available from an OSF repository described in the manuscript. This function
also lists some additional toolboxes that are necessary for rnning

The script tw_worklow.m conducts all of the processing steps. Various functions for
data processing are located in the subdirectory ./processing, and additional helper
functions are in ./helpers

The script tw_figures.m generates all of the figures in the manuscript. The functions
for generating each figure are in the subdirectory ./figure_code

The subdirectory ./examples contains livescripts that provide
additional examples of local relative rate calculation and also linear time warping.
